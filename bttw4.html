        speaking. <strong class="w3-text-red"> He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me;</strong> Now there are a lot of people sent, but they may not be sent by Jesus, do you know 
        what I mean?  We can’t just believe everything we hear.  We have to be wise.  There are some who are actually sent in the world from the Lord for this message.  
        He says, <strong class="w3-text-red"> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me;</strong> It is the same as if Jesus Christ himself – when the 
        Lord ministers through someone by the Spirit – it is the same as if Jesus Christ himself is ministering.  Now that is what the Book says.  We don’t like to hear it, but it is what the 
        Book says, and we have to receive it. <strong class="w3-text-red"> and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.</strong> The Father. I want to increase our faith to see what we 
        are coming into here, because Jesus says we are heirs and joint heirs.</p>
        
         
    

    <p class="w3-justify">We will inherit exactly the same as Jesus Christ inherited, and he wasn’t talking about trees and automobiles and all of that. He is talking about the walk in the 
        Spirit, the true spirit of God, Amen.  And all of these things would be added unto us. Amen.</p>

        works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.</strong> Man, isn’t that a strong statement?  But you see, the greater works 
        are coming when the flesh is changed from this putrid state and this putrid mind that wants to lead us away from God instead of to God.  So we know that the greater works will come, 
        than even that Jesus did, because he just sent forth a pattern showing us how to do it.  So we must have faith in God and know who sends us.  Amen. <strong class="w3-text-red">  
        And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.</strong> And here we 
        stumble, we stutter, we do everything else but to believe God and just do it.  Amen.  We are always waiting for some better time or something. <strong class="w3-text-red"> If ye love 
        me, keep my commandments.</strong> We expect to do it.  My dear, when the Lord tells us – you know if our next door neighbor tells us and we don’t have much confidence in him, then that 
        would be a different story – but this is the Lord Jesus, the Son of the living God, amen, that is saying this.  And Jesus said, 
        <strong class="w3-text-red"> And I will pray the Father,</strong> Now see how close communication he has with us.  You can’t even think but what he knows it.  He knows every thought that 
        goes through your mind.  He said, <strong class="w3-text-red"> And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;</strong> Which is 
        the Holy Ghost. <strong class="w3-text-red">  Even the Spirit of truth;</strong> Which he is. <strong class="w3-text-red"> whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither 
        knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.</strong> Oh, isn’t that a promise! You sweet Holy Ghost.  Amen.  I know where he is.  Amen.
        <strong class="w3-text-red">  I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.</strong> Isn’t that precious? <strong class="w3-text-red"> Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no 
        more;</strong> See, the world can’t see him, and listen, we can’t see him except he reveal himself to us.  But one of these days a veil is going to be taken away and we are going to see 
        him, and we are going to communicate.  Amen.  Now we have blinders on.  We are walking by faith.  This is why we have to go through this first.  This is why I say, increase our faith, 
        Lord.  Increase our faith, that we can come on in to where we don’t have to see like Jesus saw, sitting there at the table and knew who it was that was going to deny him – that it was 
        going to be Judas, and knew that the devil had entered into him. <strong class="w3-text-red"> Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall 
        live also. At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.</strong></p>  
        
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.19</p>    

    
    <p class="w3-justify">And he said the Spirit will witness, amen, the Spirit will witness with our spirit that we are the children of God.  And he sure does that, doesn’t he?  Don’t you all 
        get a witness, just oh my?  You just love him so.  You could almost scratch, you just love him so and yet you can’t just reach out and touch him.  But we are going to just hug him and 
        love him one of these days, because as I say, he is right out here.  He is with us right here in the room, and yet we can’t see, but I can feel his presence.  And I have had him even 
        come up and put his arms around me, and I have laid my head on his breast when he said, "Lay your head on my breast," when I was in such despair.  And I laid my head and there was a 
        breast there, and it scared me almost to death.  He really had his shoulder there that I laid my head on and comforted, and wept like I was washed.  Everything left – all of my despair, 
        all of my sorrow.  But he lets us have these experiences some times to increase our faith, because he knows our hearts are sincere and we really want to do his will.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red"> He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love 
        him, and will</strong> Make known or <strong class="w3-text-red">  manifest myself to him.</strong> Now look, you want some of these experiences?  And I know many of you had some 
        beautiful experiences.  Now you don’t have to wait.  You can have these great beautiful experiences. He says<strong class="w3-text-red">  and I will love him, and will</strong> Make 
        myself known or<strong class="w3-text-red">  manifest myself to him.</strong> Amen.</p>

        <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-yellow">John 14:23-26</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Jesus answered and said unto him,</strong>

        love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode</strong> Set up housekeeping, in our hearts.  Amen. <strong class="w3-text-red">  with him. He that loveth me not keepeth not my 
        sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me. These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you. But the Comforter, which is the 
        Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.</strong> Now, this is a 
        beautiful thing.  We know that that is what the Holy Ghost is for, isn’t it?  That is why he came in here.  That is what Christ died for.  He said except I leave, the Spirit cannot 
        come, the Comforter cannot come.  So when Jesus was buried and rose again and went back, then the Holy Ghost came.</p>

            might be filled with all of everything God is, everything God has, everything God ever expects to have, that we might be filled with all knowledge, all understanding, all wisdom, 
            everything. Now this is God’s wish, see.  This is his wish.  Let me read 19 again.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue">   And to know the love of Christ, which passeth

            <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> that ye might be filled with all</strong> of his fullness. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">  all the fulness of God.</strong> In every area.  
            He didn’t say, in certain areas I am going to give you my fullness, did he?  But in every area, this is the plan for mankind – that he might restore a people back like Adam was in 
            the beginning, even in greater.  Because Adam just fellowshipped with him, but he wants a people that will have all of his fullness.  Amen. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Now

            to believe, to receive, to clean our self, to walk after the image and likeness of God. This is the whole thing.  As long as there is any of that left in us, then we are limiting 
            God. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end.</strong> See, you have got to take every word.  He 
            says man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.  Now I know the Bible says that the earth will be destroyed.  But what did he say 
            before the flood?  He was going to destroy the earth.  Didn’t he?  He did.  He covered it with water.  Didn’t he?  But when the water receded, the earth was still there, and Noah 
            walked out on the green grass.  Amen.</p> 
            
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.22</p>        

    
    <p class="w3-justify">He said I have reserved the earth as to fire this time.  We are going to have some fire around here one of these days.  Amen.  That is what the Bible says.  Amen.  
        And he says the heavens being on fire out here – this earth, the oxygen, all of this junk that is going to explode.  That is what it says in Peter.  Amen.  And atomic warfare.  Fire 
        cleanses.  That fire that works in us of the Holy Ghost cleanses us.  The fire will cleanse the atmosphere and it will burn up all the pollution and junk and it will be clean again.  
        So we have to know what he is saying.  Now, if I would say, world without end – <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, 
        world without end.</strong> Now, that sounds like a contradiction, doesn’t it? When he says he is going to destroy the earth and everything else.  Then he says he has made the earth to 
        stand forever and forever and forever – in the Psalms, several places.  So we have to know what he is talking about.  But I don’t want to get stuck on that.  Because there is too much 
        proof on these things.  It is in there, amen.  I don’t have to try to persuade.</p>
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">  Hebrews 6:1-3</strong> <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ,</strong> Now this

    <p class="w3-justify">And we cannot do it with our own selves.  I don’t care how hard you try.  This old mind and this old flesh – there is going to be something wrong.  Amen.  So he is 
        talking about a spiritual walk to let this Holy Ghost burn all of this carnality, all of this junk out of us, and the changing by the Spirit in our bodies as we walk and commune with 
        him.  The Spirit will bring us into that perfection.  Amen.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance</strong> You 
        see, I know – O Lord help me.  I used to just – I don’t care if some little thought would go through my mind, I was so determined that I was going to just – when I was first saved, 
        I’d lived such a wicked nasty stinking life, and I hated myself so bad, when I really came to the realization that somehow God loved me in spite of me, and that he had really forgiven 
        me, I’d just nearly die.  I just could hardly accept it, to think that he could really forgive me, a sinner like I was.  And to know that he really loved me.  That was another thing.  
        It took me years to learn that, to really believe it.  But I was constantly running to the altar, and I was doing everything in my power to live pure before God.  Man, if even a thought 
        would go through my mind, man, that would make me run to the altar, asking, begging God to forgive me, begging God to forgive me, begging God to forgive me.  And it would seem like he 
        would never hear me.  I knew I wasn’t getting through.  Well, that worried me.  And all of the time he was saying, "Come on.  Leave that area of repentance.  Leave that." 
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">  not laying again the foundation of repentance</strong> See?<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> from dead works, and of faith toward God, Of the 
        doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</strong> We know these things are true. Now let’s go on.
