    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red"> Hebrews 9:6-15</strong>  <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the 
        first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God. But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors 
        of the people: </strong> Because of his own sin.  So for his own life of sin, the priest would have to offer for himself before he could walk on into the second place, the holy of 
        holies.  Otherwise, if there was sin on him – he wore a band around him with a long sash, and if he died in there, no one could go in after him lest they would die – when they would go 
        to the holy of holies.  So they would pull him out by this sash.  This is the order of the priesthood.  But now Christ has broken that veil so we can go into the holy of holies.</p>

         
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-light-blue">The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made</strong> Known or 
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:</strong> As long as the law was still there, they couldn’t come into this.  Do you see 
        what he is saying?<strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Which was a figure for the time then present,</strong> It was a shadow that we might look at and say now look, that we might have a 
        better understanding of what Christ has done. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, 
        as pertaining to the conscience;</strong> It could not make him perfect, no matter how much, how many times the priests went in, it would not make us perfect. 
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal</strong> After the flesh. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> ordinances, 
        imposed on them until the time of reformation. But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to 
        say, not of this building; Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.  For if the 
        blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the 
        eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?</strong> You see, now we have hope.  They didn’t have hope back there 
        of what he is talking about now, to have a people on the earth that will walk the same as Christ walked, in perfect fellowship with God, as Adam walked even in a greater 
        measure. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">And for this cause he is the mediator</strong> The go between. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">of the new testament,</strong>
        Life. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions</strong> For our sins. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">that were under the 
        first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.</strong> And this is the reason he died: that we would not have to die to receive eternal 
        inheritance. Amen. That is what he is saying.  Although there is nothing wrong, if they don't want to accept it, he will still take us on into it with him, as long as we walk whole.</p>

        first tabernacle.  It says they are types and shadows and patterns. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be 
        purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands,</strong> Like they made a 
        tabernacle out of wood and all of that stuff, but he comes into this tabernacle of flesh – it is not made with hands. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">which are the figures of the 
        true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:</strong></p>    

    
    <p class="w3-justify">Christ lives in here, in the presence of God.  Amen.  Amen.  For us.  The way was made, otherwise the Holy Ghost could never have come into you Gary, or into me, and 
        set up his kingdom in us, with Christ.  Amen. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year 
        with blood of others; For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of 
        himself.</strong> Now he calls this the end of the world, the end of the age.  So we know that if he called it the end of the age, then he is certainly talking about now.  Amen.  It is 
        not that I am so desirous to see this come because of the glory, or so on and so forth.  It will come, but it’s that I want to help God fulfill his call. He’s been good enough to die 
        for me – Christ.  And I want to do all that I can to help him fulfill his word.  That is why I teach so hard.  That is why I study so hard.  I want to know what the will of God is, for 
        him.  Amen.  Amen <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:</strong> Now this was under the law, Genesis 3:19.  And if 
        you read the rest of the Book, you will find out what he is saying.  Under the law, it was appointed unto man once to die.  But since Christ died, if God had opened our understanding, 
        there would have been no need for man to die.  Amen.  And some of them got a hold of it, but we will to come to that. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">So Christ was once offered to 
        bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto</strong> Complete <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">salvation.</strong> It 
        doesn’t mean being saved.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.36</p>    
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">  Hebrews 10:9-22</strong> <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Then said he, Lo,</strong> Speaking of Jesus. 
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first,</strong> The old law. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">that he may establish the 
        second.</strong> The new covenant. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</strong> He 
        offered it up for us. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away 
        sins:</strong> It will cover them.  It covered them, so that God could look upon them and forgive them, but it could never take that carnal sin nature out of mankind.  Because it was 
        inbred, clear from Adam.  See, and this is what he is talking about. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for</strong> This sin nature.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> for sins 
        for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;</strong> Now when you realize that it is because of sin that the curse of death came.  It was a curse.  It was because of sin.  Now, that 
        sin nature when it is gone out – and only God can take it out – when that sin nature is completely gone, there is no more death.  He says the last enemy, the Bible says, is going to be 
        put under his feet is death, when there will not be such a thing as death.  Amen. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, 
        sat down on the right hand of God;</strong> In other words, he completed his business. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his 
        footstool.</strong> Now it doesn’t mean the guy that disobeys God.  The enemies of man was the curse of death – that all of his whole lifetime, it says he was in bondage looking for 
        that day.  Knowing that he just gets started in life – you tell me that isn’t a bondage on mankind – just get started in life and everything is going, and you just get things going the 
        way you want it and it is time to die.  You just get smart enough to know how to live and it is time to die.  That is a bondage on mankind.  God says he wants to deliver man from that. 
        Amen. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.</strong> Or cleansed.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Whereof the 
        Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before, This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their 
        hearts, and in their minds will I write them; And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.</strong> Now did we read that in verse 9?  Same thing almost, wasn’t it?
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.</strong> When they are all gone, when sin is all gone out of us, there is no more 
        offering for sin.  It is gone.  Amen.  See, if it is gone…  Shall I read that again? <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Now where remission</strong> Where they are all 
        gone.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> of these is, there is no more offering for sin.</strong> Now if the bucket is empty, it is empty.  Amen.  Then there is no more offering, 
        see. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,</strong> Christ, right into the throne of God.  But don’t 
        go in with sin on you because they will pull you out with a belt.  Remember?  You see, this is what happened to Phil (Behrendt) bless his heart.  He tried to step into the holy of 
        holies, amen, with sin on him.  And God cut the ministry right smack off.  Amen.  That is what happened.  And spared his life, thank God.  And he made us 
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to 
        say,</strong> through <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">his flesh; And having an high priest over the house of God; Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, 
        having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.</strong> This flesh body.  Let Christ do the work.  Amen.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.37</p>    
        
    
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">  Hebrews 10:35-39</strong> <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of

        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise. For yet a little while, and he that shall come 
        will come, and will not tarry. Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.</strong> He says, 
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.</strong></p>    
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Now, I had just a couple things written down here and I guess I will read just a few short scriptures here.  But something that most all of us know, I am sure, but it 
        might…</p>

    
    <p class="w3-justify">Now there is two thousand years – now we know that we are in the six thousandth, coming to the seven thousandth year, amen.  There was two thousand years from Adam to 
        Moses.  And during that two thousand years, one man escaped death, Enoch.  He had faith to believe.  It said he walked perfect before God.  And in that period of time, it says that he 
        was not, for God took him.  See, he went.  Now way back there, he had faith to believe that he didn’t have to die just because his father, Adam – I mean the forefather, Adam – died.  
        There was two thousand years from Moses to Christ.  And there was another man that stepped out, Elijah.  God told him he would not see death, and he didn’t see death.  And then there is 
        two thousand years from Christ to now, and a little over.  You see, we are starting to walk into the kingdom realm, into the kingdom age.  We are walking, if we will open our eyes and 
        see what the Book of Revelation says where we are.  Amen.  But that is another teaching. We can’t go into that.</p>
        
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.38</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Christ came to establish and restore all things from the beginning which the first Adam lost. Not because I say so but because the Bible says so.  Christ took sin and 
        death away from us if we can receive it, if we will believe the Word.  As he took the keys of the kingdom from Satan and gave them to the Church and the keys were death, hell and the 
        grave.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">I was so strong in the Spirit.  And I said, "Are we going to fail after all we have heard, after the Word of God, after the death of Christ?  Are we still going to 
        fail him again?  Are we going to fail God, this generation also going to fail God, not to go on in, as the rest have failed?"  Even the children of Israel didn’t receive the promise 
        because they didn’t believe.  It says because of unbelief they could not inherit.  Amen.</p>

    
    <p class="w3-justify">Jesus was sent to establish the kingdom, not just to save us.  So they were saved under the blood.  They were saved.  He came that we might have life and that we might 
        have it more abundantly.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Now there are just a few little short scriptures here.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Matthew 16:18-19 </strong><strong class="w3-text-red">   And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will 
        build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee</strong> Unto this Church that he is building, this Spirit church. 
        <strong class="w3-text-red">  the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be 
        loosed in heaven.</strong> Now this is Jesus saying this.  I don’t care what you ask, if you ask in faith believing, and believe my Word and walk with me, whatsoever you bind must be 
        bound in heaven, in the Spirit.  Amen.  If we bind something, it is bound.  If you say that you want to loose something, then pray for it and agree, and it will be loosed.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.39</p>    

    
    <p class="w3-justify">We run around here like we are not heirs and joint heirs.  We run around here like we are kooks.  Why don’t we believe God?  Man, if somebody would say to me – the 
        president of the bank or any of these guys – and say, "Look, you can have the whole bank.  You can have everything in there.  Here is the key, just go in."  Jesus said I have given you 
        the key.  "Just go in and take anything you want.  Strip it if you want to.  I give you that.  I give it to you."  My, we would think that was pretty great.  And they would be a flesh 
        man.  And here the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God has made such a statement as this, <strong class="w3-text-red">  And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of 
        heaven:</strong> And heaven means here in the Spirit, anything in the Spirit. <strong class="w3-text-red">  and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven:</strong> and 
        as they will agree, and he is the final authority. <strong class="w3-text-red">  and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed</strong> by God, amen, in the Spirit.  Amen.  
        I don’t know how you can get it any clearer than that.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">  Revelation 22:3-7</strong> <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">And there shall be no more curse:</strong> And what was the curse again? 
        Death. That was the curse that was put on Adam. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants 
        shall serve him:</strong> He’s in here to rule and reign when he gets complete rulership.  We are like a servant.  He is sitting in his throne, amen, and we will do everything he says.  
        We will go anyplace he says.  We will obey him in all things.  We will have no desires to want to go out here and do things.  Do you get what it is saying? 
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">And there shall be no more curse but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:</strong> Do you know how 
        hard the world tries to find peace?  Complete peace and comfort?  They will never find it in the world.  God made man’s heart to be satisfied with nothing but him.  Right?  And that is 
        the only way you will ever be satisfied.  You think, "Oh, if I get a new car.  Oh, if I get a beautiful home.  Oh, if I get the right man."  No, you wouldn’t be happy.  You’d just 
        scold him and tear him to pieces pretty soon, or else he would you.  Because man was made only to serve God, and to only find perfect peace and happiness in God.  There is no other 
        way.  God won’t allow you to be in complete peace outside of God.  And you could have all of these things in the world, and if you don’t serve God with your whole heart and put him 
        first, you are still going to be miserable.  Is that the truth?</p>
        
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.42</p>    
    

    <p class="w3-justify">There is only peace in one place and that is in Jesus Christ.  There is no other way.  God won’t allow you to be happy the other way.  Why do you think these 
        millionaires jump off these skyscrapers, and one thing or another?  You will only find peace as you are obedient to the blessed Lord that lives in you, the only place.  There is no 
        peace.  He said peace I give unto you, peace I leave with you, not as the world giveth peace.  Amen.  Because the world can’t give you that peace.  Amen. 
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">And they shall see his face;</strong> The blinders are going to be lifted. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">and his name shall be in their 
        foreheads. And there shall be no</strong> Darkness. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">night there;</strong> No darkness in us. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and they need no 
        candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.</strong> This people. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And he said unto 
        me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done.</strong> Jesus says, 
        <strong class="w3-text-red">   Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book.</strong> Of this Book.  Amen.  Amen.  I pray you have received 
        something from this today.  I have.  Amen, because it is his Word.  It is by his Word that we grow.  And we must have the Word and the Spirit.  But we can’t live by the Spirit alone.  
        We have to have the Word.</p>

      

    <p class="w3-justify">And it is truth.  Oh, if there is any way – could I wiggle my ears right or stand on my head or something to make people see the truth of God’s Word.  We believe for 
        salvation.  We believe for the baptism of the Holy Ghost, but that is not all.  That is just the products to get us started to go on into the kingdom of God.</p>

    
    <p class="w3-justify">(The vision of the helicopter – there were two propellers.  We believe for salvation, and we believe for the Holy Ghost, but we don’t believe for the third one.  
        And without the third one, it is not going to take you over.)</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Amen.  That is the interpretation.  Amen.  Praise God.</p>
