    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red"> Hebrews 6:17-20 </strong> <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the 
        immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:</strong> See, God when he makes a promise, he always confirms it with an oath of some sort. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">    That 
        by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation,</strong> That we might be comforted. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">    who have 
        fled for refuge</strong> We fled to God. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> to lay hold upon the hope set before us:</strong> And this is his hope, of this flesh being done away with, 
        this natural flesh man, that we might walk, not after the carnal but after the ways of God, that we might have that power and deliverance to deliver those that are 
        afflicted. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;</strong> See, that is 
        our hope – that we might go past this carnal flesh, this veil, so that we might go on into that perfection, that beautiful place where nothing but the peace and the joy and the power 
        of God is, that we might be a witness unto the world, that we might be a testimony unto the world, not that we want to be anything, but that he might become all in us, that he could 
        minister with such freedom through these flesh bodies.  See, so when you say, I come in the name of the Lord Jesus to help you.  And it is not us but it is him as he ministers through 
        (us).  And how can we if we are full of carnality and full of envy and full of lying and hatred, how can we represent Christ?  See, but this is the hope of the Lord, that we might come 
        into that place of purity with him.  Amen. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Whither the forerunner</strong> Christ. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> is for us entered,</strong> He 
        has already entered. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> even Jesus,</strong> Through the veil.  He went through the veil. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> made an high 
        priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</strong> Now don’t go on in your Bibles because we are not going to get on this too much.  But I must say something on the Melchisedec 
        order, which is the promise from the Lord Jesus Christ that we have a perfect right to come into that order if we will do what he tells us to do.  If we will walk in the way that he 
        has made for us, We have a perfect right to claim inheritance with Melchisedec. Amen.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.26</p>
           
        
           
    <p class="w3-justify">Now we are not going to study the history of Melchisedec here, because it would take too long, but for you that have heard and read some about him, you will understand 
        some things.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Now in the first place, Melchisedec was made like unto the Son of God that had no beginning and no ending.  Well, then what’s going to happen?  What is going to have 
        to happen?  You see, you don’t kill a spirit.  There is no way to kill a spirit.  You can kill the body.  You can kill the soul, but you cannot kill the spirit.  So if you have the life 
        of God in you, that had no beginning and no ending – are you getting ahold of it a little bit?  This is why we can inherit all things with Christ if we do what he tells us to do.</p>

    
    <p class="w3-justify">Now personally, I don’t care whether I live or die, do you understand?  I am going to come into eternal life regardless whether I live or whether I die, if I keep 
        walking with God.  But you see, the spirit that is in you, Laurie, and in me or anybody else, in Gene, and all of us, is made that it will never die.  There is no way the spirit can be 
        killed.  The spirit is an eternal, eternal part of God, and God is forever.  And when he ran into this Melchisedec order man, Jesus Christ, that had no beginning or no end – and he says 
        that we are called to the order of Melchisedec.  We are called to that order of Melchisedec, but man has never had the faith or the understanding or the revelation, whatever you want to 
        call it, to see it.  I have read many books on it.  The Scripture says that we were with him from the beginning.  Amen. </p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.27</p>    
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red"> Hebrews 6:20-7:3</strong> <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Whither the forerunner is for us entered,</strong> Into this order. 
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</strong> Now, he has already made the way for us. There is no other way we 
        could come into it. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For this Melchisedec, king of Salem,</strong> Which means peace.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> priest of the most high God, 
        who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;</strong>He’d been out on a great battle, and he'd had a terrible war, and he met Abraham when he came back 
        from this war and blessed him. And Abraham paid his tithes to him. He says,<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by 
        interpretation King of righteousness,</strong> That is who he was. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and after that also King of</strong> peace or<strong class="w3-text-light-blue">     
        Salem, which is, King of peace; Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest 
        continually.</strong> And this is our spirits.  Our spirits are eternal.  Now you see, it is going to make a big difference where your spirits go.  You can either go to be with God or 
        your spirit can go to be with Satan. The choice is ours while we have this little short span on the earth.</p>    
    

    <p class="w3-justify">And the Lord has personally revealed through the revelation of his Spirit that we are living in the days when some will not die, that they will be spared death, 
        because this is the fulfilling of this time.  In other words, like Jesus possessed his spirit being, flesh and bone, not flesh and blood.  Because now – you are a registered nurse, 
        you know, and you back there, too, that handles blood all day long in the hospital, Dwight – you know that the life of man is in the blood, isn't it?  You spill his blood and he is a 
        dead dog, isn’t he?  Amen.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.28</p>    

    <p class="w3-justify">The life is in the blood.  But, you see, there will be some creation changes in the body that they will be flesh and bone.  But the Spirit will be the life of man, 
        which is now only for sin.  Sin is the curse that caused man to die in the first place.  Adam was made a flesh and bone man.  And then as you study the Scriptures, you will see that 
        it was a process of time and his body took a change, and he became a flesh and blood man that he could die.  He didn’t die right away.  He lived for a long time.  So the curse was in a 
        process of reversing back to God’s original plan – you don’t think God gave up because Satan deceived Eve do you?  Do you think he changed his mind, what his creation should be?  Of 
        course not.</p>

    
    <p class="w3-justify">We just happen to be living in the day when he is revealing these things, in the last days that he has revealed his mysteries.  So he is revealing to us now that we 
        are living in that time.  And it is a process.  We are coming back from that process of death to the process of life.  Amen.  That you will never do it through medicine which is great.  
        Praise God for medicine and for all that they are doing, but the eternal life in the flesh will never be done with medicine.  It will be done through the Spirit of Christ that made the 
        way.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">He said he had tasted death for all man that they would not have to go this route, see.  Amen. Well, we must first be completely consumed by the will of God’s Spirit 
        to where we fully trust him for everything and let this change come.  The flesh being put to death, so to speak, not dying as we know death, but that the flesh would have no will of its 
        own.  But we live by the faith of the Son of God.  Paul said – well you know those scriptures.  I won’t even stop to quote them.  But anyway, we know that when he said that when we were 
        baptized, we were baptized unto his death, we were resurrected unto his life.  Amen.  So I don’t want to stay on this.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.29</p>    

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red"> Hebrews 7:11-17</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> If therefore perfection</strong> Now he is talking about perfection, that we 
        must be perfect even as your Father in heaven is perfect.  Remember?  You all know that scripture, don’t you?  Because I don’t want to have to stop and look it up.  
        Amen. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">    If therefore perfection</strong> So he expects perfection. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> were by the Levitical priesthood,</strong> When 
        they offered goats and stuff. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order 
        of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?</strong> Now, if you don’t understand the priesthood, this can be awful boring, but anyway, they picked men to be priests to 
        offer the blood of animals to cover for sin.  And he said: but if that could have taken away sin and if that could have brought perfection then why did Christ have to die?  Because 
        they were already forgiven for their sin through the blood of animals as the priests offered. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For the priesthood being changed, there is made of 
        necessity a change also of the law. For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.</strong> That was the Gentile. 
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda;</strong>Which we are, after Judah. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">  of which tribe Moses spake 
        nothing concerning priesthood. And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,</strong> Christ when he came. See. Because 
        the Melchisedec order was unto Abraham.  Now there had to be another one just like him come – which was Christ – to offer for us. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Who is made, not 
        after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life. For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever</strong> This is what he said about Christ, the Father said 
        about Christ. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> after the order of Melchisedec.</strong></p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.30</p>    
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">  Hebrews 7:19-25</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For the law made nothing perfect,</strong>Under the old law. It covered sin 
        but it never made anybody perfect.  Then why would he tell us that if he doesn’t intend on having a perfect people after the order of Jesus Christ?  And we know that he is.  He is 
        planning it. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did;</strong> See, but it is not fulfilled. 
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> by the which we draw nigh unto God.</strong>If we have faith to believe.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue">    And inasmuch as not without an oath he was 
        made priest:</strong> But by promise he was made a priest.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto 
        him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:) By so much was Jesus made a surety</strong> Or a guarantee. 
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> of a better testament.</strong> That we could live absolutely without the fear of death.</p>    

    
    <p class="w3-justify">It says it is nothing but a bondage unto man, always has been and always will be, until God brings some deliverers forth.  Amen.  To where we understand the Word of 
        God. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.</strong> Or a better covenant.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And they truly were 
        many priests, because they were not allowed to continue by reason of death:</strong> They couldn’t keep on being a high priest because they would get so old and they would die, see.  
        But now he said now there is a better covenant.  Can you see what he is saying?  There is a better covenant.  Amen.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> But this man, because he 
        continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.</strong>And we are supposed to be heirs and joint heirs, inherit everything that Christ inherits.  All of the authority, all of the 
        law, all of the leadership, everything, the fullness of God.  That is what he said.  <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Wherefore he is able also to save them to the 
        uttermost</strong> Not just saved to get in by the skin of your teeth, but to cleanse us, to save us to the uttermost. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> that come unto God by him, 
        seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.</strong> I just want to speak a little on verse 12 because it is so important.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.31</p>    
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red"> Hebrews 7:12</strong> <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of 
        the law.</strong> It does not mean that you go wink at sin because he has put in a new covenant.  It means that we have to be cleansed of it.  But Christ made the way through suffering 
        and obedience for us to be of the same mind as Christ, to do God’s perfect will.</p>
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">  Romans 11:7</strong> <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the 
       election</strong> When Jesus said in Matthew 24: but for the elect’s sake he would spare flesh.  He said it is going to be so bad in the last days that there would be no flesh spared.  
       In other words, man would literally annihilate the whole world.  But he said, but for the elect’s sake, Jesus said, I will come.  See, for the elect’s sake.  So now he is talking about 
       the elect, the election, those elected people.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for;</strong> Israel, old Israel could not

        every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.</strong> Amen. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For I will be merciful to their 
        unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.</strong> He’s going to cleanse us.  Amen. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> In that he saith, A new 
        covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.</strong></p>

    
    <p class="w3-justify">It is time.  The new covenant is here.  It has been here for almost two thousand years, and we are just beginning to see it, the new order that God has for the people 
        of the earth.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Now chapter 9, we don’t have too much longer to go.  And it is important that we hear the Word of God once in a while.  Amen.  Are you understanding any of this?  Are 
        you receiving?  Are you being encouraged to go on, to follow God knowing that he hasn’t changed his mind?</p>

    
    <p class="w3-justify">He is still going to have that beautiful people. Amen.</p>
