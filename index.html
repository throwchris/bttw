        but by faith." Rose M. Aluli</i></p>
    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>This message was given to the church on January 25, 1981.</i></p>
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">This is worth every sacrifice that I have ever had in my life.  This is worth every suffering that I have ever had to endure, being a Christian.  Every time somebody 
        has made fun of me and called me nuts and persecuted me for being a Christian, one look at his face (Rick Jamison) is all the reward that I need.  Amen.  And we know that there is a 
        greater reward, but this is a reward.  And when I look at each one of you, I know that it’s by the working of the miraculous mighty power of God that causes us to be like we are.  And 
        that is that perpetual grin I am telling you about.  People will think you are nuts running around so happy you don’t know what to do with it.  Anything you can say to express it, but 
        because it is a well of river of life that flows up – it is Christ himself that flows up in your being – and you just don’t know what to do with it, so you just grin because of the 
        joy.  That is eternal joy that lives inside.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">(Gene Blake comes in) Look at this young man's face (Rick Jamison).  We were just talking about people that have the joy of the Lord.  They just call you crazy, that 
        perpetual grin.  You can’t help it because it is not us, but it is Christ like a river that flows up with that beautiful joy.  And the joy of the Lord is on him this morning.  He was 
        obedient.  He used to be in this satanic church.  And one of the members of the satanic church came and smacked him one.  Well, I guess he picked the man up and carried him home and 
        dumped him on the church door.  I praise God for the simple reason that even though sooner or later that probably won’t happen in just that way, but the thing is he was fighting for 
        Christ and for what he had received and he wasn’t going to let anyone put him down.  I praise God for that.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">You can’t praise God too much.  You can’t be too happy.  He wants us to express ourselves.  And he (Jesus) was anointed with the oil of gladness, so we know that he 
        was happy too.  I don’t think he was an old pickle puss.  I really don’t.  I think he was a very happy man, although it says he was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief, but I 
        don’t think he walked around in his sorry grief.  I think he rejoiced or he wouldn’t have said when you fast don’t look like you are fasting.  You go wash your face and make yourself 
        appear as though you don’t.  Amen.  I praise God.</p> 
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">Praise the Lord.  I don’t know if I ought to teach the message.  It is burning on my heart, but if there is any ministry that wants to go forth.  Joe, why don't we 
        pray – get the mind of the Lord so we'll be in his perfect timing.  Amen.  (He does.)</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">(A vision was seen of a helicopter with only two blades instead of three.)</p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify">If you had three blades and one was broken, you would have to have faith, wouldn’t you, to believe that you are going to get home with that baby?  
        I saw that very plain.  I think we lack in faith; in fact I know we lack in faith, to believe.  We have to believe.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">The message that he had given me was: are we going to make it or are we going to sit?</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">Are we going on in and fulfill the promises that God has made in his Word to us?</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">We have believed this far for salvation.  We have believed again for the baptism of the Holy Ghost.  We have believed again for some of the manifestations of the 
        Spirit.  Are we waiting for him to manifest himself again or are we going to take his Word and start believing? </p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.1</p>   

    
    <p class="w3-justify">You see, he has done great manifestations of the Spirit in front of us.  But it is more than that.  You see, it is the faith that will do the work.  We have to step 
        out in faith like he said.  The Bible says that he that is without faith cannot please God.  And he says the children of Israel failed to go on in because they lacked in faith.  
        They didn’t believe God.  And when the leprous man, (I believe it was, now I may have two stories conflicting but the understanding is the same.) – they were starving to death within 
        the city, and they were besieged by enemies – and the lepers had said, “Oh, we might as well go on into the enemies camp.  We are starving to death anyhow.”  So they go on into the 
        enemy’s camp, and God confused the enemy.  Remember how they slew one another and ran and left everything they had?  So the leprous men went into the city and – this is Scripture – they 
        had eaten to their fill, and there were jewels and there was just everything they needed, all kinds of armor, everything that was of value.  They said, “We don’t need all of this for 
        ourselves.  Look, back at the city they are starving to death.”  So they go back to the city and here sits the king, I believe, sitting at the gate.  And anyway, they came and told the 
        man that there was plenty – the army.  And he was a leprous man; he wasn’t supposed to even come close to the city.  And he told about all of the wealth and all how the army had spread 
        and left and everything.  So anyway, the man said he didn’t believe it.  He just didn’t believe it.  But anyway, they sent out part of their army to find out and investigate and sure 
        enough, it was true.  And it says because the man did not believe, the old prophet of God said that he would die.  He would never partake of this bounty that God had given them, because 
        of unbelief.  And sure enough when they came in – there was such a great press of the people when they come back in carrying all of this spoil of all that they had got – that he fell 
        off and broke his neck and he was trampled.  You see, it is just that unbelief again.  We have to have faith.  We have to believe the Word of God.</p> 

    <p class="w3-justify">Now I had to believe the other night that this thing had to go (Legion of devils), because the Word of God says you shall cast out devils in my name.  So I had to 
        believe that.  And it is the same for everything that we receive.  We have to believe it.  We have to know that God’s Word cannot lie.  The Scriptures also say that he watches over his 
        Word to perform it or to bring it to pass.  What God wants is somebody that is going to believe him so he can do the work.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">Because he works by faith and not by feelings and not by seeing, but by faith. And he says that faith is a substance of things not seen.</p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify">So we know that there is a real movement out here of the Spirit that is very real, but because we are human, and I want to get on to some of this in the teaching, the 
        lesson this morning, that there are more, the Scriptures say, of the unseen or invisible than of the visible.  There is more, or a greater realm, right out here in the spirit world, but 
        because we are flesh and our eyes are blinded to spiritual things and to spirits, we don’t see them.  But the Bible says there is more of the invisible than the visible.  Now that is 
        the Word of God.  But it is hard for us to believe it because we are flesh and we see through the natural eye, the natural flesh eye.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.2</p>    

    <p class="w3-justify">First, I am going to say this about the kingdom of God.  The kingdom of God is not houses and lands and food and drink.  You remember?  But it is Spirit.  Now once we 
        can establish that and believe it and know it, then we are going to have a better understanding.  The kingdom of Satan is also spirit.  But, you see, you can feel the Spirit of God.  
        You can see it.  He said it is like the wind, the trees blow.  You don’t see the wind, but you see the effects of the wind, when the trees blow and it picks up a paper and rolls it 
        across the field.  You don’t see that force that is doing it, but you see the effects.  It is the same with the Spirit.  We don’t see what he does to actually change us.  Now I didn’t 
        visibly see Satan come out of him (Rick Jamison), but I see the effects of it.  And I feel the effects of it when it happens.  I know the Lord witnesses with my spirit that the work is 
        done.  And so it did.  It was a witness of the Spirit in my spirit.  And this is the Bible again, that says his Spirit will witness with our spirit.  And our flesh and mind must come 
        under complete control of our own spirit.  Remember we are spirit, too.</p>
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">We are three, body, soul or flesh – our inner being – and our spirit.  Now the spirit that we have in us – everyone is born, the breath of life comes by the Spirit of 
        God, the same as it did when God breathed life into Adam.  And he became a living soul.  So the spirit, our spirits are pure before God.  Now, these are hard things to understand unless 
        you walk in a spirit realm.  But I think we are going to get where we can understand it.  Our flesh and mind must come under complete control of our spirit through the one great Spirit, 
        the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, which, the Bible says: although they are three, which is a mystery, yet they are one in complete agreement.  And we have to have our spirit, and 
        we have to stay under the control of the Spirit, of the one great Spirit, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, so that we can become that one spirit that is part of 
        God’s Spirit that is within us after we accepted Christ, that it becomes in unison with the one great Spirit.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">What did Jesus pray in the 17th chapter of John?  That we might all be one: God the Father, God the Son and us.  See?  This was the one prayer that meant so much to 
        me to know that Jesus prayed it.  And any prayer that he ever prayed will come to pass, that we might all be one.  He doesn’t chop God up in a bunch of pieces, you see?  And Christ 
        doesn’t have to come back and die again for every soul.  He did the work one time for all, for the whole world, if they would accept it</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">Now God gave me an order that most of us have had for some time, for this day, an order in the Spirit.  He showed me just a few of the things that were spoken.  We 
        won’t read the whole order.  Most of us have it.  God’s Order for the Sons of God in the last days.  And the Spirit came upon me.  I won’t go into a long story, but for some of you that 
        weren’t here, God moved on me in a very unusual way at home.  And just as fast as I could write he gave me the order that he expects out of his sons of God in this day, and the heirs 
        and the joint heirs with Christ.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.3</p>

    
    <p class="w3-justify">So Order # 2 was: We must have a breakthrough, now, we must have a breakthrough into the real overpowering power of the unlimited resources of God.  We must have, if 
        we are going on any farther than we are now, to just being believing Christians.  If we are going on into the kingdom realm that God tells us about in the Word and expects.  And some 
        people will come into this kingdom, where we are heirs and joint heirs with Christ.  And he said if you will suffer with me, you will reign with me and all of this and that.  Well, 
        what’s he talking about?  There is a manifestation out here, a reigning with Christ.  So we must have a breakthrough.  Now, we haven’t come to that yet.  We have had some marvelous 
        breakthroughs, but we have not broken through into the real overpowering, that is a power that is so overpowering that we will take the kingdom out of Satan’s hands, which Christ died 
        for and gave the keys to the Church, that we might bind Satan in the forces of sickness, the forces of disease, all things, and of sorrow and of wealth.  All of these things were 
        contained in what the Lord has died for.  And into the unlimited resources of God.</p>

    
    <p class="w3-justify">You see, we haven’t touched the resources of God yet.  You see, all we have to do is open your eyes, and all you can see is are a few little stars out there, but we 
        don’t have any idea what the resources of God are.  And he said that he would give his sons power and authority over all of these things.  Now this could blow your mind.  But for us 
        that have been studying about what the Lord has been speaking, we know that it is real.  It is very real.  I wouldn’t teach it if I didn’t believe it with all of my heart, if I hadn’t 
        completely searched the Word of God.  Now I have been a Bible student for over 45 years and have studied much along this line, and I mean study.  I study.  And I am still studying.  I 
        still don’t know only that much, but I know enough to know that God has another work to do in the earth to bring in this kingdom of his, Amen.  But I mustn't stay on this.</p>
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">The 3rd one says: We must now learn to build back the manifestation of the Spirit in truth according to the Spirit.  Now a lot of things that I have seen through the 
        years, and still do at times, that we label to be the Spirit of God moving, sometimes it is not.  Sometimes it is our own spirit.  Sometimes it is motivated by the flesh or just can be 
        many things.  But we have to have that breakthrough to where the only time that we move is by the Spirit of God.  Now this may be a little hard for some that haven’t followed long, but 
        I am teaching mainly to you sons of God that have heard these messages and understand.  And some of you will understand that have never heard it before.</p>
        
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.4</p>    
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Now #6 says: There is a manifestation of the flesh.  And we know that.  When we just do things after the flesh.  There is a manifestation of the Spirit also where just 
      the pure true Spirit of God moves.  And he manifests himself through flesh.  The flesh men must be under control of the Spirit if we are to accomplish what God wants us to accomplish to 
      set people free.  Because we can’t do it.  We are flesh like anybody else.  And unless we give ourselves to the Spirit for him to unleash his power through us.  This is God’s plan.  Jesus 
      said, “It is finished.”  He completed it.  Now it is up to us.  He said, "Even as I am in the world so are you."  You see?  In other words, he went.  He said: I was the light of the 
      world, now ye are the lights of the world.  That is what the Bible says.  And he left it in man’s hands, more or less, with his help by his working through us by his Spirit.  Now I don’t 
      want to drag on here too long because we have got quite a bit.</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">Now #8 says: These flesh vessels must be emptied out and cleaned before the Spirit will manifest through us in this new order about to be revealed.  Our own wills, our 
      own plans, our own desires, all of these things must be emptied out.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Now there is a spirit of slumber that is trying to take over here, and this is one thing that we are going to have to resist.  I am going to tell you why.  This 
      happened; this is a spirit that comes in.  Joe, I want you to bind that spirit of slumber.  (He does.)</p>
