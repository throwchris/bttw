   <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red"> But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and 
        in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken 
        up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.</strong> Do you know he had power to appear and disappear?  Do you remember that he walked right through the door when the doors were 
        locked and appeared to the disciples?  What’s he talking about?  (Unlimited power.)  You see, they were in there just grieving themselves to death.  Then he just appeared and said, 
        “Thomas, put your finger in the hole in my hand and put your hand in my side and see where I was pierced.  It’s me.”  Oh, but he says – but not out loud; no record of it, but I can just 
        imagine what he is saying in his mind – “Oh, we buried him.  He’s a spook.”  He said, “Look, I am not a spirit as you suppose.”  So he must have been reading their thoughts, but he 
        said, “Handle me and see.  I am flesh and bone.”  He said, “Does a spirit have flesh and bone?”  Now is this the Word of God?  Well, then what do you think we are going to be when we 
        are going to be exactly like him, in his image and in his likeness, after this cursed sin is completely worked out of our bodies by the Spirit and by the fire of the Holy Ghost?</p>

      
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Flesh and bone, absolutely. There will be a change. He says we shall not all sleep.  Some shall be resurrected and some shall, you know, and we shall be caught up 
        together in the Spirit again.  We have got to know what these things mean.  And we shall all be changed in the twinkling of an eye.  He said we won’t all sleep.  He called 'dead' 
        'sleep'.  But we will all be changed.  We will have that glorious body likened unto his glorious body.  Now we just studied in Corinthians and those books, you will know, absolutely, 
        what he is saying, what the change will be.  He didn’t say he was flesh and blood.  Flesh and blood – now we have taught on that.  We are not going to get into that.  We live by blood 
        now.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">And another thing, when he went down to the seashore, when they got discouraged because he was dead.  So they go down.  Peter says, "I go fishing" – going back to his 
        natural life, because Christ is killed; he didn’t set up his kingdom.  Oh, what a sad state, no faith to believe the word that he had told them.  He told them what was going to happen.  
        So Peter says, "I go fishing".  The others said: we go also.  So they go out and fish.  Well anyway, we know how the Lord stood on the shore and he says, “Children, do you have any 
        meat?”  Or did you get any fish?  Well anyway, we know how he told them to cast the net on the other side, and then how he cooked fish and bread and ate with them after he was 
        resurrected from the dead.  Isn’t this beautiful?  This is Scripture.</p>
        
       
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.11</p>       
        
    <p class="w3-opacity">(One asks why he says, "Don’t touch me for I am not yet sanctified.") </p>    
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Well, you see he had not returned unto the Father yet.  I don’t think that he had the same body, it was after, you know, and the blood and everything.  I don’t really 
        know that anybody really knows what he meant when he said, "Don’t touch me."  He just appeared and said, "Because I have not ascended to my Father and your Father, and my God and your 
        God."  I just think that there was something in the ceremony of God, the purity and everything, where he had to be absolutely pure, untainted by any flesh whatsoever.  That is my own 
        personal opinion.  Because flesh is putrid no matter how you – he had to go back and he disappeared.  He had to go back into the Spirit for all of this that he had to do.  So it was 
        something in the ceremony of God and the mystery of God that we don’t (understand), I don’t believe.  I have heard many people talk about it, but it has never satisfied me in my heart 
        to say that.  There are some mysteries that God just doesn’t open the whole book to us.  But I actually believe that he couldn’t let putrid flesh (touch him), which it is.</p>   
       

    <p class="w3-justify">He says the flesh is an enemy of God. It always has been and will be, until God changes it. Because it deceives us. It’s a mockery. It will drive us to hell if we 
        are not careful. Because the flesh mind will tell us – you'll say you want to go to church, and you’ll say: ah no, I’ll go have a beer. I mean that is flesh, see. And we can either 
        listen to it or not.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Anyway, I am going to have to keep going.  My dear, my dear, I am not even started.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">Anyway, he said a cloud received him out of their sight. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two 
        men stood by them in white apparel;</strong> Now, I imagine that blew their minds too, just suddenly to have two men appear. It says men, it didn’t say angels. You see, remember – the 
        Lord keeps quickening things to me and I want to get to the message, but he isn’t going to let me, I guess, because he keeps showing me other things.  You know when Jesus went up on the 
        mount and there was Moses and Elijah, appeared to him – scared the disciples almost to death – and they were in flesh bodies. He opened their eyes so they could see Moses and they 
        could see Elijah.</p>
        
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.12</p>    
    

    <p class="w3-justify">And he opened their eyes so they could see the two men, who they might have been.  Who knows maybe it was one of the other prophets from old that appeared.  Do you 
        see?  (And Jacob wrestled with an angel.)  He cracked him one on the hip, didn't he?  And he carried it the rest of his life for his disobedience, and it says he broke his stubborn 
        will and called him Israel instead of Jacob from then on, because Jacob meant 'stubborn' and Israel meant 'peace'.  So he changed his name even, after that wrestle with him.  So you 
        see now, these are definite proofs of what is right here.  I don't think they had come from seven billion miles or so to be with the Lord.  They just appeared.  Their eyes were open 
        and they understood what is right here. You see God – well anyway, we won’t go into that.</p>
        
    
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong>Acts 1:11</strong>  </span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Which also said,</strong> These two men. 
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Ye men of Galilee,</strong>You see, they knew where they were from, didn't they.  It wasn’t unfamiliar to them. 
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go 
        into heaven.</strong> Staring out into obscurity.  Do you know where heaven is?  You know what it says in the Bible, don’t you?  The first heaven, the second heaven and the third 
        heaven, and the heaven is in the air.  Now you go up here – what is it – seven miles, and there is no more air.  They are caught up here, and are right here.  The Lord is telling us 
        something, if we could just see it.  But we won’t get on to that one, argue over that, because I don’t give a hoot. I know, I mean, what God has shown me.</p>    
  

    <p class="w3-justify">I get excited about the Word of God. It is my life. It is the truth. It is my salvation. Amen.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.13</p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong>Revelation 1:5-7 </strong>  </span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the 
        first begotten of the dead,</strong> He was the first one.  Now there are going to be many, but he was the first begotten of the dead. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and the prince 
        of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us,</strong> Christ. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and washed us from our sins in his own blood,
        </strong> Now listen to this.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. 
        Behold, he cometh with clouds;</strong> Now we made a big study on clouds, remember?  We found out that there are very few clouds ever mentioned in the Bible except when Elijah prayed 
        and a cloud came the size of a man’s hand.  Most clouds are called the glory cloud, the glory of God.  Anyway, we want to establish in verse 7 what clouds are.  We know there are 
        clouds out here, but this isn’t what he is talking about.  Clouds of witnesses and clouds of glory of God, amen.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and every eye shall see him, and they 
        also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him.</strong> Now, this is what the Lord showed me.  He says the whole earth.  Now if he would appear 
        somewhere, how would the whole earth see him?  Now we know he is out here, because it says that disciples going forth doing signs and wonders and Jesus working with them daily, even 
        though he was supposed to have gone with the Father.</p>
    

    <p class="w3-justify">All right, there will be an unveiling to our natural understanding of the spirit world.  See, he says you look in a glass darkly now, beholding your face, darkly, 
        the face of the Lord.  This is one of the great mysteries that will come to pass according to what God says in many, many places.  I never get one scripture and teach it that that’s it, 
        because we have to see the full meaning as we take the whole Book and study on that subject.  There is coming a great unveiling of our eyes to where we will look and we will see Isaac.  
        We will look and we will see Abraham.  We will look and we will talk to the Lord.  There will be a complete unveiling of all of the mysteries of God to us, to our natural, to our eyes, 
        not just in the Spirit.  This is all a mystery by faith now.  But Christ has died that this unveiling might come.  Now he went through that veil, see.  And he tore the veil in two that 
        might be made for us, but in our natural sinful flesh as we are – bodies – we cannot at this time, he will not permit it at this time, for this to happen.  But this is another thing 
        that is coming, the unveiling of our understanding where we will have full knowledge, full understanding of all things that we are surrounded with.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.14</p>    

    
    <p class="w3-justify">Now I know that there are angels in this room, see.  I know that.  And sometimes he lets me really see some things, but that is a beginning, a little entry into the 
        things.  And you know how I saw the Lord going up over me that day and then how I was changed – my body was changed right in front of my eyes, scared me almost to death.  But I say I 
        have had some glorious experiences – not for me to boast in, because you can’t do it yourself; it has to be God – but that it might encourage and strengthen others not to give up hope, 
        but that we might be strengthened to go on, to obtain these things.  And the Lord wants us to obtain them.  Amen.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">All right, now according to the Scriptures, Jesus has already fulfilled his part in the kingdom and he has set it in motion.  Because when he said that he had 
        fulfilled all things and he had completed his work, he said he sat on the right hand of the Father.  Now that doesn’t mean he is sitting on a chair somewhere.  Amen.  But it means that 
        he has ceased from his work.  He has ceased from his labor.  He completed the thing.  Now it is up to us, by his Spirit, to follow his Spirit, because he made the way through.  He said: 
        I have overcome the world and all the things of the world, and we can also.  He has made the way that we might do that.</p>

    
    <p class="w3-justify">We quoted this the other night over him (Rick Jamison) when we saw God’s power move and deliver him.  That was part of the kingdom work now. Only part of this is 
        fulfilled now, but we are beginning to see into the kingdom.  Only part of this scripture is fulfilled, that we are going to read.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.15</p>    
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-light-blue"><strong>Mark 16:15-18</strong>  </span>And Jesus said, now this was just before he was taken up.  And they had been asking him 
        questions. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And he said unto them,</strong> <strong class="w3-text-red"> Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. He that 
        believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them that believe;</strong> He says they shall – not maybe.  You 
        believe; it is going to happen. <strong class="w3-text-red"> In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;</strong> Now that is the power, again, not that the 
        tongue in itself is the power, but it is the Holy Ghost that speaks when he comes, amen, when he sets up his kingdom.<strong class="w3-text-red"> They shall take up serpents; and if 
        they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.</strong> Now we don’t run around eating poison and tempt God by saying: 
        now your Word says.  If you do, you better go to a doctor first, amen.  Because I know.  The boys have heard me testify how I found those lovely berries that I liked, and I couldn’t 
        wait for them to bloom every year, and I would go out there until the bloom would come, and then the berry to get ripe so I could eat them.  And I would eat them by the handsful, and 
        it was so good, and I just loved it.  Carol knows this.  And finally a farmer come over – that was on the island, and a farmer came over.  And he said, "Oh man, you have a cow over 
        here?"  He said, "You’ve got deadly berries.  If that cow would get and eat any of that, it would kill her dead."  I said, "You mean they are poison?"  He said, "Well, you know they 
        fight it with everything, but it got started over on the island."  Of course I didn’t know they were poison and I was eating it every year – deadly night shade.  And I would just eat 
        it by the handsful.  And I never ate it again, because I thought, "Now I know."  But God had preserved me.  If ye eat any deadly thing, you see, by mistake, so this is what he is 
        talking about.  And you know when the scorpion fastened himself on Paul’s hand and they expected him to fall dead, and instead of that he shook it off into the fire and went right on.  
        And they tried to worship him as God because of the miracle, see.</p>    
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Now this is part of the kingdom walk.  And as I said, only part of this is fulfilled.  The new kingdom spirit man will completely fulfill it to where nothing – he 
        says there is nothing unclean, there is nothing unpure.  To the pure – those that are completely pure – there will be nothing unpure.  But it is the way we are made.  Amen. God is 
        going to change all of that.  Amen.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.16</p>     

    
    <p class="w3-justify">I want to show you how this works when you start coming into the kingdom like Jesus was.  He said now is the kingdom in the earth, right there with them, because the 
        kingdom was in him, and they couldn’t see it.  They said when are you going to set up the kingdom?  The kingdom is now in the earth, you see, already in the earth, in other words, 
        because he was a kingdom man.</p>
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong>John 13:1-3</strong></span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus 
        knew</strong> He knew.  Now who told him?  See? <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the 
        Father,</strong> Now somebody didn’t (tell him) – it had to be by the Spirit.  He had come into that place in the kingdom where he was knowing all 
        things.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end. And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of 
        Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him; Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;</strong> Now you see, he 
        had reached that place in the earth – now this was in his natural body – he had reached that place where he knew all things. He knew the devil had entered in Judas Iscariot.  He knew 
        that it was his hour to be offered up as a sacrifice, and he also knew that the Father had given all things over into his hands. And he also knew that he came from God and went to 
        God.  Where do you think you come from?  There is one Spirit.  Like I say, it is not chopped up in many pieces.  Every man that ever breathed in the earth, part of his life, he has put 
        into every man a measure of faith by that Spirit.  There is a portion of that man and woman that has come out of God, because he said, "Before I come out of the loins of Abraham, I 
        knew you."  Do you see?  It is all the way through.  Amen.</p>
