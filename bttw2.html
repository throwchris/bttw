    <p class="w3-opacity"></p>

    <p class="w3-justify">You see the main theme of this message, if there is a theme, is that we might awaken to the hour that we are living in, to the shortness of time,
        and the call that has gone forth now in this last hour when the world is right in the place that God said it would be in Bible prophecy. And he is getting ready to really raise a 
        people up that will go forth to do the things of God. And we must awaken to this.</p>
        
      

    <p class="w3-justify">Now in #9, now here is what God had promised.  God has promised, according to his Word, unlimited power, didn’t he say?  Jesus said, "All power is given to me in 
        heaven and in earth."  And then he turns around and he gives the keys to the Church and he says, "Go forth and heal the sick, and raise the dead, and cast out devils."  All the things 
        that he did, he told the Church to do.  Well, we are hearing a lot of word but we are not seeing a whole lot done.</p>   
   

    <p class="w3-justify">But look what he has promised.  God has promised unlimited power to those who qualify and ready themselves in these last days to receive creative power, that you could 
        create the same as God creates by the Word of God.  You see, he doesn’t change.  God doesn’t change.  Now this is what he is demanding of a people, that we would receive it.  We have to 
        have this breakthrough into this, and we have to have faith to do these things.  Creative power, unlimited discernment.  Oh, I want to get onto that in a minute.  It is really something 
        when you see what God is going to – when he takes these veils off our face, amen, off our eyes.  Unlimited knowledge, now that’s the promises of God.  It is in the Book.  Unlimited 
        healing power, so we won’t have to be sick.  To be translated, to be transported, now these are promises in here, transcending into the very power and presence of God himself.  Jesus 
        made that way through the veil.  All limitations of flesh gone.  This is the Word.  Complete authority, now this is God’s promises.  Can we get a hold of it?  This is what some people 
        are going to do.  Now he has offered that to us if we can do it, if we can accept it and believe God.  Complete authority over all sickness, disease, death, kingdoms, Satan, 
        governments, cities, wickedness, and power over all flesh.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-light-blue "><strong>John 17:2</strong>  </span><strong class="w3-text-red"> As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give 
        eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.</strong> You see, Jesus received all power from the Father and he said he would make us to rule and reign with him and we would be joint 
        heirs with him – receive the same reward, receive the same authority, receive the same power as what he has.  Now don’t think that is going to make you puffed up because there is only 
        one way you can come into that, and that is becoming nothing and letting him become all.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.6</p>
    
       
    
    <p class="w3-justify">And then in #12: this can only be achieved by a knowledge and a relationship with Christ by faith, and a knowledge of God’s Word, and faith to believe it.  I don’t 
        care how much you hear, if you don’t – a doctor can say to you, "Now if you take this medicine, you’ll get well."  You see?  Well, just because you go visit the doctor and you take the 
        medicine and set it on a shelf, you aren’t going to get well.  It is the same thing.  The Lord has given the antidote for every need of life right here in the Word, but if we don’t 
        receive it and take it in faith and believe it, it will do nothing.  It will set there.</p>
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">In 17 it says: expect great things from God.  Now this was God speaking to me that day.  If you are obedient in all of your commitments, seek to know his will by his 
        Word before you ask.  He cannot fail.  Then he said wait.  And I waited.  Then he said wait.  And I waited some more.  And then he said wait in peace, knowing that all things work 
        together for good to them that are called according to his purpose.  If we walk, not after the ways of flesh or the desires of our own mind, but if we walk after the Spirit.  And that 
        is in Romans, the Book of Romans.  And that is just a little on this.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Now, you see, God allows – and this is nothing to you (Gene) because I faced death.  You face death.  And we are all going to face death if we, you know – but here is 
        what God spoke to me several days – long before I had seen you the other day.  God had given me part of this lesson.  God allows death to those he cannot recreate.  Now it is a 
        re-creation, and death is a blessing. It doesn’t necessarily have to be a curse.  If a man is suffering from something, or a woman, it is a blessing rather than to be so handicapped.  
        Death is a blessing.  And he lets that come to many that won’t believe his Word, that can’t believe his Word. Some just can’t believe his Word, and for those that he cannot recreate.</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">He wants to recreate us into the likeness and the image of Jesus Christ. Is that what the Word says?  Now you have heard it, haven’t you, many times?  Into that 
        likeness and into that image, to have a life where you will never die.  Now there was a time when that couldn’t have happened, but these are the last days.  Then we know that he said in 
        the last days all of these things would happen, and death would be put away.  All of these things will be done away with. He says a man will seek death and cannot find it because it 
        has been destroyed – the curse of death, Amen.</p> 
        
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.7</p>     
    

    <p class="w3-justify">God intended that every disciple should be manifested sons to the fulness of his Son, Jesus, and in his image.  That is what he said.  He made us in the image and 
        likeness of God.  He made Adam.  He said, "Let us make man in our image and in our likeness," God the Father and God the Son.  And he made Adam.  But then along comes Satan and he did 
        his little thing and they fell, so we have all been born under the curse. Then Jesus comes along to lift the curse and dies that the curse might be lifted.  And we still have been 
        dying ever since.</p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify">But that curse was lifted when Christ died, that we would not have to die. The Bible says so. Now we are not going to stick onto this because we have accepted it.  
        But I will show you about him in a little while, but there was some that has escaped him.  Amen. Unbelief and we have not known how to get the curse out of man, that sinful nature out 
        of man and woman, out of mankind.  We haven’t learned that sin is the curse, their disobedience to God.</p>   
   

    <p class="w3-justify">You see, the first thing when God made man and the curse came upon him, he has had a desire and he has worked on it ever since and he promised that there would be a 
        people in the last days that would walk free of the curse, because he does not want to have that curse on his dear loved ones that he loves, his blessed creation.  He does not want to 
        see man die.  He does not want to see man suffer.  He does not want to see sickness and sorrow and grief and struggles, but we have brought that on ourselves, you see, mainly.  We 
        couldn’t help it.  It is our ancestors.  We’ve just created these in the fallen nature of man, instead of being those beautiful spirit beings that God intended us to be.  You remember 
        in the Garden of Eden how he came down and he walked with Adam in the garden, had fellowship – complete communion and fellowship with him.  I imagine they would just link arm and arm 
        and walk through the garden and talk about the beautiful things.  And then what was happening?  Satan was working all the time, underneath, and finally he got a hold of Eve, and Eve got 
        a hold of Adam and that was the beginning of sin.  It was sin because it was disobedience.</p>

    
    <p class="w3-justify">All disobedience, the Bible says, is sin.  So if we disobey the Word of God, then we still have that in us.  But Christ has made the way now, for in this age, some are 
        going to be set absolutely free from the curse of sin, because they are going to be subject to the Spirit and the laws of God, and that God cleaned us out.</p>
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">Christ paid that price for us, that the curse could be lifted for his creation.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong>Acts 1:1-5</strong>  </span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus

        talking about a kingdom here. And he is going to fulfill that kingdom. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">  And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not

    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong>Matthew 3:11-12</strong>  </span>John speaking here, John the Baptist. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> I indeed baptize you with 
        water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I,</strong> Speaking of Christ. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">  whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall 
        baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire: Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with 
        unquenchable fire.</strong> Now what is he talking about here?  We are the wheat of the earth, he said.  You see, and when the Holy Ghost comes, he comes as a consuming fire.  It says 
        God is a consuming fire.  He comes and he sets up his throne right here, in the heart of man.  And this Holy Ghost comes in.  He comes and he said his fan is in his hand to burn, to 
        make that fire burn a little hotter in us, to burn out all of these things that are unlike God.  That is what the Holy Ghost is for, not to hurt us, but to purge us from all sin.  That 
        he might gather his wheat – which we are, his wheat – into the granary, we call it – it was a garner.  But he will burn up the chaff; the things that are hay, wood and stubble that can 
        be burned will be burned out of us, and we’ll become pure before God.  That is what it is all about.  Amen.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.9</p>    
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong>Luke 17:20-21</strong>  </span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of 
        God should come,</strong> The Pharisees would come up and torment him. They said, "I wonder when you are going to set up this kingdom?  You claim to be the Son of God.  Now when are 
        you going to do all of this?" <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> he answered them and said,</strong><strong class="w3-text-red"> The kingdom of God cometh not with 
        observation:</strong> You can’t see it.  Amen.  Thrones that he is speaking of are places in the Spirit, power in the Spirit.  And they were looking for – they were under Roman rule in 
        the land of Israel, the nation of Israel – were looking for some great king to come in like they had always looked for, to deliver them out of their natural bondage – in the which this 
        will also be a deliverance for that realm, too.  But they were looking just for a natural kingdom instead of a kingdom that would save them from all of their – you know what’s in man, 
        what we’re made of – to get rid of all of that garbage.  Jesus says, <strong class="w3-text-red"> The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo 
        there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.</strong> Are you reading that?  Man, you can’t deny it.  It is the Word of God.  Can we?  If we can’t believe this, then we can’t 
        believe any part of the Scriptures, right?  Let’s say that again. <strong class="w3-text-red"> Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within 
        you.</strong> Us.  You and you and Gene and you, you see, all of us, that is where the kingdom of God is.  You can’t see it.  Man, you can sure feel it though can’t you, Rick?  See, 
        that is the kingdom of God working. Amen. Praise God.</p>
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong>Acts 1:6-10</strong>  </span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue">  When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, 
        Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?</strong> See, the disciples were the same way.  They could not see beyond the natural man, into this great spirit 
        kingdom that we can’t even see.  He said, "Know ye not that you are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses?"  Those that have gone on.  Amen.  I know it sounds spooky but 
        it’s the Bible.  There are kingdoms, there are thrones, there are powers.  Where do you pray to God, where?  Did we say he is in here?  Isn’t this where his kingdom is?  Isn’t this 
        where he sits on the throne – in your heart?  It is different, isn’t it, when you really get down and see what the Word of God says. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">  When they 
        therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?</strong></p>    
    

    <p class="w3-justify">They expected a great warrior to deliver them from Roman rule and restore Israel.  And we are the same now.  We are not really looking to God for the kingdom.  Are we 
        really?  Really, we say we are and we know there is no other hope outside of God, but did you know he is going to use people like Rick and Steve and Eric and Crotchety over here and all 
        of us together.  Amen.  (I know your name is Lori, but that's all right.)  Praise God.  You see he takes humans, and not only us, but all of Christendom out here.  He will call them out 
        of here for that special job, and that one and that one and that one.  Then there will be many come from all parts of the earth.  I am not dumb enough or stupid enough to think that it 
        is just our little people.  My, my.  Amen.  Amen.  He is going to call them from all parts of the earth.</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">He said they will come from the East and the West and the North and the South and come and sit down in the kingdom with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Is that what he 
        said?  Amen. But I must teach the Word of God because that is the only truth we have really, real truth. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">  And he said unto them,</strong> 
        <strong class="w3-text-red"> It is not for you</strong> This is Jesus speaking. <strong class="w3-text-red"> It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put 
        in his own power.</strong> But he did say, in other places in the Scriptures, that we would watch for the signs, that we would know, that we would not need to be ignorant because he 
        would reveal it to us by the Spirit.  Now they were looking for a natural kingdom, and he was saying: hey boys, open your eyes. I am talking about a spiritual kingdom, the work I am 
        going to do in man so he can really set up a righteous kingdom in the earth by removing all of this sin nature out of man so that he doesn’t have to die, so that he can rule and reign 
        with Christ forever.  Amen. </p>
